# Introduction to Quantum Computing #

This folder contains the material for the introductory mini series on quantum computing using python and qiskit.

We begin with some definitions and then we proceed on implementing standard quantum computing algorithms such as entanglement and quantum teleportation.

Note that if you want to part of the notebooks where we execute the experiments on the quantum machines you need to register an account on https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/
and create a file token.txt with your personal access token.
