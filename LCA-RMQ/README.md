# LCA-RMQ: The first ever algoholics get together #

So on May 25 2018 something great happened. I was always fascinated by this specific result of solving the Lowest Common Ancestor 
and Range Minimum Query literally optimally (which is very weird in CS Theory) by continuously reducing the one problem to another
and of course incorporating some very clever Algorithmic Black Magic.

That made me think that this is something that must be shared, the beauty of this result and the fascination it gave me is something
that should be shared with the world. That's why I wanted to gather all my fellow students and friends and show them this sexy piece
of CS Theory and that's when Algoholics was founded.

In this folder you can access all the material covered in the presentation. Unfortunately we didn't record it so you won't
be able to see me poorly explaining the results. But I got something even better, in the following link you can see a Erik Demaine, who is
a true legend on these topics, cover this exact material and even more(In the end there is a discussion on solving level ancestors optimally
which we didn't cover on our talk).

Enjoy!
